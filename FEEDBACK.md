# Feedback

## Workflow
1. Lack of communication in case of problems and questions. Trying to 
solve everything by myself even with wrong result. Need to interact with 
team members more actively. Don't be afraid to ask "silly" questions or 
task-related questions
2. Keep in mind OOP and sw design best practices while designing code 
entities (classes, interfaces, variables, naming etc.). Read more about 
encapsulation.

## Theory to learn/refresh
1. AWS Lambda internals:
    - Internals
    - Concurrency (reserved)
    - Constraints
    - Limits

2. AWS DynamoDB:
    - Partitioning
    - GSI
    - LSI

3. Python:
    - Output buffering

4. Misc:
    - POSIX signals (internals)
    - String interpolation


## Code improvements
1. Refactor `DockerContainer` class (broken encapsulation)
2. Make test input works (bash command interpolation)
3. Make graceful shutdown wait for rest of the logs
